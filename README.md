This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Node.js applications using Express.js: unhandled errors within asynchronous callbacks.  The `bug.js` file contains a server that simulates an error that occurs randomly within a `setTimeout` function.  Because the error is asynchronous, standard `try...catch` blocks within the Express route handler won't capture it.  The solution, shown in `bugSolution.js`, uses appropriate error handling techniques to gracefully manage the error and prevent the server from crashing.
